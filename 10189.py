10189 Minesweeper:
Have you ever played Minesweeper? Itâ€™s a cute little game which comes within a certain Operating System which name we canâ€™t really remember. Well, the goal of the game is to find where are all the mines within a M Ã— N field. To help you, the game shows a number in a square which tells you how many mines there are adjacent to that square
