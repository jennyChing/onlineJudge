10356 - Rough Roads

Input
The first line of each test case contains two integers: n (the number of junctions, 1 < n < 501) and r (the number of bi-directional roads connecting these junctions). The junctions are numbered with 0, 1, . . . , n − 1. The gate of the village and the grandfather’s house is situated at junctions 0 and n − 1 respectively. Each of the next r lines (one for each road) contains three non-negative integers: two junction-numbers that the corresponding road connects and the length of the road in kilometers. A road always connects two different junctions. Length of a road is not more than 20km and not less than 1km.

Output
For each dataset, print the set number (1, 2, . . .) in a line followed by the length of the shortest path.  However, if it is not possible to reach there in the specified way, print a ‘?’
