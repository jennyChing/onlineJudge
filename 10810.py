10810 - Ultra-QuickSort

In this problem, you have to analyze a particular sorting algorithm. The algorithm
processes a sequence of n distinct integers by swapping two adjacent
sequence elements until the sequence is sorted in ascending order. For the input
sequence
9 1 0 5 4 ,
Ultra-QuickSort produces the output
0 1 4 5 9 .
Your task is to determine how many swap operations Ultra-QuickSort needs
to perform in order to sort a given input sequence.
