11404 - Palindromic Subsequence
A Subsequence is a sequence obtained by deleting zero or more characters in a string. A Palindrome is a string which when read from left to right, reads same as when read from right to left. Given a string, find the longest palindromic subsequence. If there are many answers to it, print the one that comes lexicographically earliest.
