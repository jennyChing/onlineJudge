11695 - Flight Planning

Help the company by writing a program which finds the best flight to cancel and the best new flight to add so that the maximum number of flight changes a passenger might have to make when travelling between any pair of cities in which NCPC Airways operates is minimized.  The input will be constructed so that it is always possible to improve the maximum number of flight changes needed.
