524 - Prime Ring Problem

A ring is composed of n (even number) circles as shown in diagram.  Put natural numbers 1, 2, . . . , n into each circle separately, and the sum of numbers in two adjacent circles should be a prime. Note: the number of first circle should always be 1.

Input
n (0 < n â‰¤ 16)

Output
The output format is shown as sample below. Each row represents a series of circle numbers in the ring beginning from 1 clockwisely and anticlockwisely. The order of numbers must satisfy the above requirements. You are to write a program that completes above process.
