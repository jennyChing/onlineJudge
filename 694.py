'''
An algorithm given by Lothar Collatz produces sequences of integers, and is described as follows:
    Step 1: Choose an arbitrary positive integer A as the first item in the sequence.
    Step 2: If A = 1 then stop.
    Step 3: If A is even, then replace A by A/2 and go to step 2.
    Step 4: If A is odd, then replace A by 3 âˆ— A + 1 and go to step 2.
